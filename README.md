### Summary
This is an exercise I did for Makers Academy, during the first week, to learn RSpec.
it was particularly useful to learn to use the Date and Time classes
It's an IRB app I'm working on, it can store a list of birthdays, and check who's birthday is today and how old is the person celebrating their birthday.

### Requirements

I want a program that I can load in IRB that allows me to
- Store all of my friends’ birthdays so I can keep track of them
- See them all at once with their names and birthdays each on a line in a tidy format
- Check whose birthday it is today - the program can check through the birthdays I have stored and check each one to see if it’s someone’s birthday, and tells me something like "It's Mary Poppin's birthday today! They are 124 years old!" - otherwise it won't say anything.

More requirements:
- Test-drive extracting a birthday class
- Isolate your birthday list class using a mock for Birthday
